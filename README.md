# Java_Example

Program I built to play a hand of BlackJack. Each file should be saved as a separate .java file in the same directory.
Running Test.java allows you to play the game.

Rules: A player can only split their hand once,  but they are allowed to double down after they split. If the player gets 
BlackJack (21 in two cards) after they split it doesn't count as a natural BlackJack. The player is allowed to split all 
values of 10 (i.e. they can split a Jack and a Queen). If a player busts, they automatically lose,  so if their first hand
of a split busts, and their second hand doesn't, and the dealer busts, then their first hand loses and their second hand wins. 
Additionally, the dealer does not look at their second card until after the player has gone. The player doesn't lose 1.5 times
their bet if the dealer has BlackJack, but they are still able to double down if they want. Their is no insurance, 
surrender, or split after splitting. All other standard BlackJack rules apply.
